# Overview:

This Java project provides a simple example of creating and running a multithreaded application using Java's Runnable interface. Multithreading allows concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single Java program, enabling efficient utilization of system resources and enhancing performance for tasks that can be executed concurrently.

# Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the fundamental concepts of multithreading in Java and provide a starting point for understanding concurrent programming. By creating multiple threads that execute independent tasks concurrently, this project illustrates how to leverage multithreading to improve application efficiency and responsiveness.

# Features:

**Runnable Interface**: The project utilizes the Runnable interface to define the tasks performed by each thread. By implementing the run() method of the Runnable interface, the project encapsulates the code that runs concurrently in separate threads.

**Thread Creation**: The project demonstrates how to create multiple instances of the Thread class, each associated with a Runnable task. By passing Runnable instances to Thread objects, the project initiates concurrent execution of the defined tasks.

**Concurrency Control**: Through the use of thread synchronization techniques such as Thread.sleep(), the project manages the timing and sequencing of thread execution. By introducing delays between thread operations, the project ensures orderly and synchronized execution of concurrent tasks.

# Project Structure:

**MyRunnable.java**: Defines a class implementing the Runnable interface, encapsulating the task to be executed by each thread.

**MultithreadExample.java**: Contains the main() method and serves as the entry point of the program. It creates instances of MyRunnable and initiates multithreaded execution.
